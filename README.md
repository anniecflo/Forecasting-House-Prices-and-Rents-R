In Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques), XgBoost was used to predict housing prices and the model achieved around MAPE 0.12.

In UMN's project, multi-regression model was used to predict US housing rents. Factors that help predict US housing rents were also identified.
